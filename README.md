# HANGMAN in Python

****Description:****

This hangman game was an assigned project for NMSU ICT-362-M70-SOFTWARE TECH II course. The game is a classic in-which you have a player guess letter by letter a hidden word that is kept secret using blank spaces. The only hint in the beginning of the game is the number of letters that are present in the hidden word. As you guess correct letters they are revealed in the approapriate location in the blank spaces. If you guess an incorrect letter not present in the hidden word the game draws a body part. If you get the correct word before all the body parts are drawn you win the game. However, if you guess too many times the game will draw a full man hanging which is not good news for the player. 

****How to Play:****

Once you have the folder of assets downloaded on your local machine you will want to open terminal and open the folder into your terminal's working directory. In the terminal type ******python hangman.py****** this should automatically load the game into the introduction page.

The game will prompt you to type a category of your choice. Once you have typed the answer you wanted the game will choose a secret word of that category to display to you in a blank spaces. A prompt asking you for a letter of your choice should be displayed. The game at this point will continue asking the same questions as you attempt to solve the hidden word.Once you have won or lost you should see another prompt to continue playing the game. Just above that prompt you will also notice a 'game information' displayed that will provide the revealed hidden word and your win to lose ratio. The more you play the win to lose ratio will change. Hopefully your desire is to continue challenging yourself using a good game of hangman to do so.
